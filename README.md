# AnimatingBannersWithAnimateCSS
Learning CSS animation by experimenting with Animate.css, a library of readymade animations for web browser projects. 

Knowing how expansive and powerful CSS is, I know that I have barely scratched the surface when
it comes to customizing interfaces with it. I've seen a lot of projects that have animated CSS, 
and I am starting to explore animation by experimenting with a remade library, Animate.css
(https://animate.style/).
